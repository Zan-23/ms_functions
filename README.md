## Dashboard
- .....name of dashboard we are using.....

# Challenges we ran into
One of the most challenging parts was the integration of image processing pipeline into the python script. We were also dealing with many problems when deploying the python script in the Azure Functions, as the application was perfectly working localy but wasn't working deployed. Therefore, we decided to run it localy.

# What we learned
We have learned how to distribute the work among ourselves and also gain experience in the fields we have never worked before (Azure Cloud Computing Services).

# Requirements
- Azure credentials
- .....dashboard name we are using.....
- python dependecises - see 'requirements.txt'
